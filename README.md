# BilliardND
N-dimensional billiard with point-like particle and elastic scattering

* *SinaiND.hs* is a module with functions that compute a sequence of collisions of the ball with the billiard walls. Rectangular, Sinai and elliptic Sinai billiards are covered and generalized to any dimension.

* *Collisions.hs* is a module that studies the set of collisions returned by billiard functions from *SinaiND* module

* *Geometry.hs* is a module with types and functions used by the other modules.

* Type `runhaskell write.hs` to write results in the *results* folder
